# INTELLIGENT-INTERVIEW-AGENT-TO-ASSESS-PERSONALITY-TRAITS-AND-PREDICT-JOB

The project involves taking video inputs of the interviewee and aims to predict
the Five Big Personality traits namely openness, agreeableness, neuroticism,
conscientiousness, and extraversion of the interviewee as perceived by experienced
human resource professionals. It is widely regarded as a reliable and recognized
personality scale, with applications in business and psychological research. The
application associates a particular score for each of the traits which signifies the degree
of dominance of that specific trait in that individual. Based on the score obtained for
personality traits, a suitable job is predicted to the user. Video of the candidate is taken
as input and converted into frames before giving them to a TensorFlow-based CNN
model that predicts scores for each of the personality traits and based on the values
obtained, a model built using a machine learning algorithm predicts a suitable job for
the user. As a result, the application assists both applicants and interviewers in
achieving their goals.
